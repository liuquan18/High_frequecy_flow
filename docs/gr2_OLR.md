# OLR composite
## 1. Reconstruct North Atlantic zg related OLR
1. **6 days of gap:** MCA(OLR, NA_zg_6days_later)
2. **reconstruct** use first 50 components (explains more than 85% of variance) of Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA) to reconstruct tropical OLR.


## 1.1 composite of OLR against positive NAO extreme events

## 1.2 composite of OLR against negative NAO extreme events

## 2. bandfilter 2-8 days
2-8 days of bandpass filter before the MCA to get the synoptic scale OLR.
